### Question     
What is true faith? 
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus was amazed by the centurion's faith and healed his servant. 

+ Jesus raised from dead the son of a widow in the town of Nain. 

+ Jesus' identity clarified through John the Baptist's question and Jesus' answer. 

+ A woman's sins were forgiven for her faith. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - For the centurion's faith, Jesus said: "I have not found such great faith even in Israel." As God's elected ones, we are His children and made righteous by faith. Do I have any difficulty to have faith in Him? 

+ **Integrity** - The woman knew she was unworthy so she humbly gave her best to Jesus. Do I often examine my heart to reveal my own weakness and humbly come in front of the Lord to ask for forgiveness?
