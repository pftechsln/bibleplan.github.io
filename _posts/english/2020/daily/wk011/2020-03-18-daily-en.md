### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Six days before the Passover, Mary took about a pint of pure nard, an expensive perfume; she poured it on Jesus' feet and wiped his feet with her hair. 

+ The next day the great crowd that had come for the festival heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord! Blessed is the king of Israel!" 

+ Jesus replied, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified." 

+ Jesus said, "When I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all people to myself." 

+ Even after Jesus had performed so many signs in their presence, they still would not believe in him. This was to fulfill the word of Isaiah the prophet. 

+ Jesus said, "Whoever believes in me does not believe in me only, but in the one who sent me." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Jesus said, "Very truly I tell you, unless a kernel of wheat falls to the ground and dies, it remains only a single seed. But if it dies, it produces many seeds." This parable tells us the meaning of His life, it also encourages us to think about the meaning of our life. How may I let God use me?
