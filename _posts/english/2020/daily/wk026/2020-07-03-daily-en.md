### Question     
What are the blessings for being obedient and the punishments for disobedient?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Proclaim the blessings and punishments after the covenant was made. 

+ Verses 3 to 13 are the blessings: rain comes, crops grow, peace in the land, and Israelites' number increase. 

+ Verses 14-46 are the punishments: disasters come, crops die, wars rage, famines occur, and people die. Not all disasters would come simultaneously. God always give His people chances to repent and turn around. Each time a disaster strikes, the next disaster comes only "if in spite of these things you do not accept my correction but continue to be hostile toward me." 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God blesses His people. He blesses those who obey His commands and love Him. Do I often see God's mercy and love by counting the blessings He has bestowed upon me? 

+ **Integrity** - God sends disaster to people not to punish them but to give them a chance to turn around. What characters of God do I realize from the incremental disasters He places? Have I in my life been reminded or impeded by the Holy Spirit? Am I willing to understand His will and turn around to obey Him?
