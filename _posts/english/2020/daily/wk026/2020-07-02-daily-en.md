### Question     
What are the regulations on blasphemy, killing, and Sabbath Year?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Leviticus 24:10-22 records the punishment laid upon a Gentile who blasphemed against God and thus committed an offense of the 3rd law of the ten commandments. "You are to have the same law for the foreigner and the native-born. I am the Lord your God." 

+ Verses 25:1-22 are about the regulations on Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee. Verses 25:23-55 talk about the necessary attitude toward property and poverty to realize the meaning of Sabbath Year and Year of Jubilee. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Sabbath occurs after 6 days of work. Sabbath Year occurs after 6 years of work. The Year of Jubilee occurs once after every 49 years. What was God's intention for these? Do I know the true meaning of Sabbath? Do I often take refuge in God? 

+ **Community** - Verses 24:17-22 list the punishments for injuring others and their animals. God shows us the attitude we ought to have toward poverty and property in verses 25:23-55. What is my attitude toward other people around me and their property?
