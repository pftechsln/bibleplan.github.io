### Question     
What offering is for committing unintentional sins or what God's command forbids?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The first of the two Offerings for sins. 

+ Sin Offering is for unintentional offenses. Bringing the offering comes from the requirement of the law, not of voluntary act. 

+ Leviticus 4 lists who need to bring Sin Offering. Israelite community, leaders, individuals of the community, ordained priests. All Israelites need to bring Sin Offering. 

+ Leviticus 5:1-13 lists three examples. None of these are premeditated offenses.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - Anyone who committed a sin unintentionally needs to bring Sin Offering with no exception. What do I see how God views sin? 

+ **Identity** - Israelites often need to bring Sin Offerings in Old Testament as the results of the offerings were limited. In contrast, the Sin Offering that Jesus Christ, the Highest Priest, made for us resulted in saving us all forever. How do I value myself in light of this fact?
