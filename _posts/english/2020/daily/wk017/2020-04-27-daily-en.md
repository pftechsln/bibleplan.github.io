### Question     
How did God reaffirm His promise to Abram?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Genesis 17 continues the theme on God's Promise, the Covenant of Circumcision, reaffirming the promise of the nation, the descendants, and the land. 

+ Before the promise of descendants was fulfilled, God made Covenant with Abram with circumcision, from which Abram and his descendants were chosen and to be the blessings of all people. God renamed Abram to Abraham and Sarai to Sarah. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God's promise seems to be out of reach. Abraham lowered himself to God in flesh but not in his heart and laughed. Am I a superficial follower by doing things my way? How does God's reaffirmation of His promise encourage me? 

+ **Identity** - God's renaming of Abram and Sarai signifies their new identity. Do I value the new identity Jesus Christ has given me?
