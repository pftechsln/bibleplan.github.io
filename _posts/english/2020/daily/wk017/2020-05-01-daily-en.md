### Question     
What is the proper response to God's promise?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Through God's test of Abraham's faith, we learn how should we respond to His promise; Abraham got the first piece of land God promised him. 

+ God tested Abraham and asked him to offer Isaac as a burnt offering. Abraham was obedient through faith and God supplied the ram instead. God's Covenant to Abraham was reaffirmed again. Sarah died and Abraham bought land to Bury Sarah. It was the first piece of land he had in the promised land. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ Walk with God - Abraham got to know more about God through the test: The Lord Will Provide. Have I or am I experiencing tests in my own journey of faith? How have these tests helped me to know more about God? 

+ **Integrity** - What have I learned about faith and the actions that come from faith through the story of Abraham's offering of Isaac? (Ref. Hebrews 11:17-19, James 2:21-22)
