### Question     
What happened to the descendants of Israel in Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The background of Exodus. The curtain raiser of God's salvation plan. 

+ Israelites were tortured in Egypt, but they grew stronger with God's blessing. Moses was born and saved by God when Pharaoh was killing all newborn male Hebrews. We must remember God is always in control no matter what dangers and circumstances we may face.  

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - The God-fearing midwives saved the life of eventual Exodus leader, Moses. Am I God-fearing and willing to walk with Him under any circumstances? 

+ **Identity** - All Hebrew male infants were being slaughtered when Moses was born. Through God's blessing, Moses was taken by Pharaoh's daughter and grew up in the palace. He killed a person and fled to Midian. Everything happens to a person, be it persecution or setback, comes from God for the good purpose of equipping him/her. How does knowing this fact help me identify myself and recognize my own experiences positively?
