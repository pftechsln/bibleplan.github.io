### Question     
Would Joseph's brothers change? 
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joseph's brothers came to Egypt to buy grain the second time. Joseph tested them again. 

+ Through Joseph's test, God led and changed Judah's life from brother-selling to self-sacrificing. God put us through difficult situations to help us to face our sins and cause our lives to change. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Judah's life was changed with the test. Judah pleaded for Benjamin and was willing to substitute for him. Do I have similar experiences? How can I rely on God to help me win over my past sins and turn me around? 

+ **Integrity** - Judah praised Tamar for being more righteous. Judah's life was renewed and his family was greatly blessed with Lord Jesus Christ to come from his descendants. From his selling of Joseph, failing of father-in-law's duty to Tamar, to the second grain buying, what do I see in his spiritual growth? How does the story of Judah remind me about my own spiritual growth?
