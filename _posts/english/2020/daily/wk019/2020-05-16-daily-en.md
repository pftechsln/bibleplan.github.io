### Question     
How did Israel arrive in Egypt?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Joseph made himself known to his brothers and comforted them. Israel brought the whole family to Egypt. 

+ Through the dreadful act of selling Joseph, God saved Israel's entire family. God fulfilled the promise that Abraham's descendants would go to Egypt. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Israel went to Beersheba to offer sacrifice and prayed to God before going to Egypt. His spiritual life grew even more. God led Israel and made him humble, gentle, and faithful. How does the story of Israel's life encourage me? 

+ **Community** - Joseph comforted his brothers when he made himself known to them. He told them that even with the evil heart of man, God's plan is always for the good. Man's forgiveness is limited but God's salvation is boundless and infinite. Only by leaning on God can man obtain the true freedom. Joseph relied on God to better his relationship with his brothers. How does Joseph's story encourage me about my relationship with members of my family?
