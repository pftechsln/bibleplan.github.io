### Question     
What is gospel?  
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The source of gospel is God. 


+ The main character of gospel is Jesus. 

+ Gospel is spread through disciples and Paul is the example for all messengers of gospel. 

+ The righteousness of God is shown through gospel so that all may be saved by faith alone. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Paul is not ashamed of gospel. His attitude toward came from the grace and the calling from God. Have I ever been ashamed of gospel? Recall the events that happened to Paul in the Book of Acts. Would I stumble if any of those happen to me? Pray and ask God to strengthen my faith in walking with Him. 

+ **Fidelity** - Paul's hope and love to the Roman Christians are shown between the lines. He prayed continuously for them and wished to share with them his spiritual gifts. Think about the people around me, my children, my family, my siblings, my friends, my co-workers, and all those whom I serve. How should I pray for them?
