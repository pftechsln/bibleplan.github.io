### Question     
How does a sinner become righteous?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Man's unfaithfulness does not diminish God's faithfulness. Our unrighteousness makes more apparent God's righteousness. 

+ There is no one righteous. All are under God's judgment. 

+ Through God's grace and Jesus' salvation, those who are faithful are declared righteous. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Through faith in Jesus Christ, we are given righteousness. What is my value as being declared righteous? What should be the focus of my life to be commensurate with this value? 

+ **Fidelity** - Should God not judge us for our sins if God's righteousness is made more apparent by our unrighteousness? Since God's elected would stand up even after they fall, should those who cause them to stumble argue with God? How should I serve God whole heartedly without looking for excuses?
