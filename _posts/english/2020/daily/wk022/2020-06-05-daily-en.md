### Question     
What were the details in the instructions for building the Tabernacle?
{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The detailed instructions in building the Tabernacle. Including the curtain, tent, frame, altar, courtyard, lampstands, etc. 

+ God does not dwell in what man has made. But with such detailed instructions, God wanted His people learn to live an obedient life and to set apart their best as holy and offer to God. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Walking with God** - God wanted to dwell among man and gave detailed instructions to build the Tabernacle. We can see how God wants us to live. Can I offer the best of myself to God in my journey with Him? 

+ **Fidelity** -The intricately detailed instructions require great patience and attentions. Do I serve God with great patience and pay great attentions?
