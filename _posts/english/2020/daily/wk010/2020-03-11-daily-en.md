### Question     
Why those who believe in Jesus will rise to live?

{% include BibleLinks2020.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ In Bethesda, Jesus cured a person who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years. 

+ The day was a Sabbath, and so the Jewish leaders said to the man who had been healed: "The law forbids you to carry your mat." They also accused Jesus for breaking the Sabbath. 

+ The Son can do nothing by himself; he can do only what he sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the Son also does. 

+ Whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged but has crossed over from death to life. 

+ Jesus said, you study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me. 

+ Jesus said, if you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Fidelity** - Jesus can do nothing by Himself; He can do only what He sees his Father doing, because whatever the Father does the He also does. We make Jesus our example which includes how He follow the will of the Father. What does this passage remind me of?
