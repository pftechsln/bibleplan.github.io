### Question     
Where does the river of living water Jesus mentioned come from?

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ Jesus said: "My time is not yet here." 

+ Not until halfway through the festival did Jesus go up to the temple courts and begin to teach. My teaching is not my own. It comes from the one who sent me. 

+ Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment. 

+ You know me. I am not here on my own authority, but he who sent me is true. 

+ The chief priests and the Pharisees sent temple guards to arrest Jesus. 

+ On the last and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and said in a loud voice, "Whoever believes in me, as Scripture has said, rivers of living water will flow from within them." 

+ Thus the people were divided because of Jesus. Some wanted to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - Jesus' teaching is not His own. It comes from the one who sent Him. Whoever speaks on their own does so to gain personal glory, but he who seeks the glory of the one who sent him is a man of truth; there is nothing false about him. Reflect on my own conduct. Is it based on God's word or my own experience and judgment?
