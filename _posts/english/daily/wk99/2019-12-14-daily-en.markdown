### Question     
What seven churches did John write to?
{% include BibleLinks.html %} 

### Meditation: God's Story   
+ The church in Ephesus, you have forsaken the love you had at first. 

+ The church in Smyran, do not be afraid of what you are about to suffer, I will give you life as your victor's crown. 

+ The church in Pergramum, some among you have hold to the teaching of Balaam. Repent therefore! 

+ The church in Thyatira, you tolerated that woman, who calls herself a prophet, to mislead my servants by her teaching. Hold on to what you have until I come. 

+ The church in Sardis, remember what you have received and heard; hold it fast, and repent. 

+ The church in Philadelphia, since you have kept my command to endure patiently, I will also keep you from the hour of trial that is going to come on the whole world to test the inhabitants of the earth. 

+ The church in Laodicea, you are neither cold nor hot. I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so you can become rich. 

### Meditation: My Story   
+ **Identity** - God says: "Those whom I love I rebuke and discipline. So be earnest and repent." In the Father's house, we shall not be afraid, because He loves those who repent. What do I need to repent today?
